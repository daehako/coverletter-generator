While reading your cover letter, the recruiter shouldnâ€™t have to look far to find who wrote it. Your document should include a basic heading with the following information:

- Full name
- Pronouns (optional)
- Location (optional)
- Email address
- Phone number (optional)
- Relevant links, such as your LinkedIn profile, portfolio, or personal website (optional)

You can pull this information directly from your CV. Put it together, and it will look something like this:

John Doe
He/him
San Francisco, California
johndoe@mypersonalemail.com
myportfoliosite.com

Alternatively, if the posting asks you to submit your cover letter in the body of an email, you can include this information in your signature. For example:

Warm regards,

Jane Doe
She/her
Anywhere, Anystate
janedoe@mypersonalemail.com
555-123-4567
myportfoliosite.com
