2. Employer's contact information

5. Middle paragraph(s)
    
This is the main body of your cover letter. Use one or two paragraphs to highlight your qualifications, skills, and experiences that make you a strong fit for the job. Be specific and provide examples of your relevant wins. Explain how your background aligns with the company's needs and values. You can also discuss your motivation for applying and how you can contribute to the company's success.

Remember to keep your cover letter concise and focused. It should typically be no more than one page in length. Proofread your letter carefully to ensure it is free from spelling and grammatical errors. Tailor each cover letter to the specific job application to make it as relevant and impactful as possible.
